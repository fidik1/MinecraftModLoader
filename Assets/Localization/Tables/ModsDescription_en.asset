      If you like spending time in the lower world,
      surviving in harsher conditions and fighting dangerous mobs, then Nether Plus
      Add-on is sure to please you!


      This mod will make the Nether World even
      harder to survive by adding a lot of new hellish creatures to MCPE! Now you''ll
      be able to meet hell pigs, fight new imps and golems, or catch up with hell
      mushrooms. Or maybe you decide to confront new bosses by summoning the Eye
      of Cthulhu, the Wall of Flesh or the Infernal Golem?


      Whatever you decide
      to do in the underworld, with Nether Plus Add-on it will be much more interesting!
      A lot of new mobs fit perfectly into the atmosphere of the game, as if created
      by the developers themselves.'

    m_Localized: 'Mutant Wolves mod


      Mutant Wolves mod will add two new types
      of wolves to the game - big mutants and bone wolves.


      Despite the fact
      that the wolves in the Mutant Wolves mod are wild predators, you will be able
      to tame them and even use them as a sledding animal. And also, their skin can
      be colored in any color available in the game, using dyes.


      Absolutely
      all new creatures from Mutant Wolves mod have very nice animations. They can
      wag their tail, yawn, bark and look incredibly realistic in the game.


      As
      it is first of all a mutant, it is stronger and has much bigger size in comparison
      with the standard wolves in the game. They can be found in forest biomes, but
      quite rarely. A tame wolf can have its fur color changed, making it more friendly.


      This
      reanimated mutant wolf skeleton features increased strength, increased health
      and size. Bone wolves inhabit the underworld and are aggressive toward the
      player and other creatures. You have a small chance to tame these "hellhounds",
      after which you will be able to color bones using dyes.'

      of different creatures from mythology will appear in the MCPE world - minotaurs,
      werewolves, orcs and others!

      add to MCPE more mechanics, creatures and weapons from such games, then this
      add-on is perfect as a mod for new mobs. Now, during your adventures you will
      be able to meet new dangerous enemies, and the game itself will become a little
      more difficult.


      Minotaurs:

      These huge mythical creatures that
      are giant bulls with heavy melee weapons are an extremely dangerous enemy.
      They have 150 HP and will attack any living creature that comes into their
      sight.


      Orcs:

      Orcs will settle in all forests and live in small
      groups of 2 to 5 creatures at a time. They have 80 health units and their attacks
      deal 15-20 damage, they are also hostile to the player and civilians.


      Wyverns:

      Wyverns
      are mythical dragons that will appear in MCPE along with the Mythical Creatures
      mod. You will be able to tame a baby wyvern with any kind of raw meat, and
      as soon as the creature grows up, put on a saddle and fly it!


      You can
      meet the wyvern in the deserts, forests and mountains. Be warned, its attacks
      are poisonous and cause poisoning for 20 seconds.


      Centaurs:

      Another
      type of mythical creature that is known throughout the world. Centaurs can
      attack their enemies both up close and from a distance. They live in the savannah,
      mountains, and plains.


      Loch Ness Monster:

      One of the most famous
      mysterious creatures whose real existence is still in question. In the world
      of MCPE, you can tame their cubs, and once they grow up, use a saddle and chest
      to move quickly across the water.


      The Loch Ness monster cannot live
      on land for a long time, so you always need to keep this in mind. As food,
      it prefers all kinds of vegetables and root vegetables.


      Werewolves:

      As
      expected, werewolves from Mythical Creatures mod are capable of changing their
      appearance depending on the time of day. During the daytime they will look
      like normal humans and you can even trade with them. But at night they turn
      into dangerous enemies, who only crave fresh blood! Besides, you can only kill
      them with a golden sword!


      Necromancer:

      This new mob is capable
      of resurrecting dead creatures and summoning them to his side. The Necromancer
      is able to gather a whole army of zombies, skeletons and other creatures, then
      roam the world of the game and destroy entire villages.
